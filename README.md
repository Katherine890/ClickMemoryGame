# ClickMemoryGame

## Overview
A Fairly Odd Parents-themed memory game created with React. This game features twelve characters from the 2000's TV show. Challenge your memory and avoid clicking each cartoon card twice.


## Playing the Game
Each time the user clicks on a cartoon card, the cards will shuffle. By clicking on each character once, the user's score will increase by one. However clicking on the same card more than once will result in "game over" and the user's score will reset to zero.


## Getting Started
Users may get started by clicking on the deployed link below. The user will be directed to the game page. There, the game will automatically start whenever user clicks on a cartoon card. Get the highest score by only clicking on each cartoon card once.
